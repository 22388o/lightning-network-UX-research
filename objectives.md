# Objectives

The goals of this research can be presented as three broad themes:

1. Identify the current state of development of the Lightning Network in relation to how ready it is for regular use \(i.e., not only specialized testing\).

2. Visualize how a user interface should be built in order to accommodate the new functions of the Lightning Network and provide a good usability and experience.

3. Review usability aspects and design decisions of the current solutions of graphic interfaces, taking into account the early stage of development they are in.
