# Summary

As the Bitcoin Lightning Network comes to life thanks to the work of various professionals that committed themselves to make it happen, the need for an interface that will communicate the technology to users also arises. Throughout this study, we will discuss what is the current situation of that interaction between users and Lightning payments; we will comment on the design process of creating an interface thinking about the people for whom it is for and, consequently, propose the main elements that should figure in a usable application; and, lastly, we will review three different existing projects \(the wallets [HTLC.me](https://htlc.me/), [Zap](https://zap.jackmallers.com/) and [Eclair](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.eclair.wallet)\) that are still on development but are some of the main known efforts for creating user interfaces for the Lightning Network. The research and the preparation of this written material were conducted between February 16th and the end of March, 2018.

## Motivation

As a new piece of technology that is to be plugged into Bitcoin, the Lightning Network will impact the way users deal with transactions and their peers. The objective of this compact study is to analyze some of the expected changes — if any — in usability that may be felt by users and what are some possible approaches to make this adaptation a smooth and comprehensible process.
