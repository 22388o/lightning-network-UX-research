# Conclusions

After conducting the research in its entirety, a straightforward answer can be given, using the knowledge and data collected along the way, for each of the objectives defined in the beginning of this document.

###### Identify the current state of development of the Lightning Network in relation to how ready it is for regular use \(i.e. not only specialized testing\).

The current state is considered to be **not ready for use**, unless the user's purpose is to test and aid the network development. Even in that case, the only apt user, at the moment, is a techninically expert user who can perform all the necessary operations without the help of a graphic user interface. That's not a failure of any type by the developers of the Lightning Network, it's just a part of a healthy development timeline conducted by serious professionals. It would be irresponsible to consider it completely ready at the moment.

Nevertheless, the evolution is going on full-steam and the situation might change in a few months. Even during the period of this study, one of the main implementations of the Lightning Network, lnd from [Lightning Labs](http://lightning.engineering/), has become [available for the mainnet](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2018/03/15/lnd-beta.html) \(in beta\). A consistent rate of development has been perceived util now and it's expected to go on like this. It would be reckless and risky to build such a system in a rushed manner.

###### Visualize how a user interface should be built in order to accommodate the new functions of the Lightning Network and provide a good usability and experience.

As it would be with any other technology, be it groundbreaking or  the 

###### Review usability aspects and design decisions of the current solutions of graphic interfaces, taking into account the early stage of development they are in.
